# MLH-Daily-RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors Bot

This game is built using Unity 3D engine.

Mechanics Behind Game:
Every time, user clicks one of the button(i.e. rock/paper/scissors) we store that value.
We generate a random variable for the cpu and compare it with the value stored beforehand using swtch-statements.

Not-so-actual-Mechanics :
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors literally cuts paper
